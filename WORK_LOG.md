First, my intial idea was that if we are given the overall board then it'll be difficult to solve the problem, however, if we break it up into sub problems (for example if we have an 'island' that is disconnected from the other groups) then we can treat that as its own problem. Another thing I though is that if price of highway < price hospital then we simply need to find the # of highways that has a greater cost than a single hospital. Therefore, we can know how many highways away from a single hospital you have to be in order to have a new highway. For example, if you a highway is 2$ and a hospital is 3$ then if you have a single town that takes 2 roads to connect it to another hospital, you might as well just build a hospital there because its cheaper than building 2 highways. |

My goal is to loop through all the cities and store an arraylist of the number of cities in each sub group (each disconnected graph). Then, at the end you return the sum of the number of nodes in a given sub graph - 1 * highway cost + a single cost of hospital (is hospital price is > than highway). If highway is more expensive then just place a hospital at every node. For this algorithm to work we will also create a map for O(1) look up times to see if you have already visited a node. This helps you decide when to move onto a new sub tree or when to create one. |

I coded a helper function that essentially returns in Integer[] storing the number of nodes in each sub graph / disconnected graph. Although I'm yet to test this function I coded it to use BFS to explore every single set of nodes. If it completes a loop and can't continue in its current tree then it simply moves to the next tree and appends the number of nodes in the last subtree to an arraylist. I also coded the code to calculate the cost given the two scenarios, the simple scenario where the highways are more expensive than hospitals in which you just return n*hospital price. I also have coded the method of calculating the cost if you have the other case, which is more complex. |
| Sept 12 | 10:15pm - 10:45pm | In this iteration I realized a really stupid mistake which would explain why my code wasn't working. For context, I ran tests on the code from the previous iteration but all the tests except 1 failed. I then re-looked over my code for my helper function that calculates the subtrees and found that i was returning my queue.toArray... not my arraylist subtrees.toArray. This simple mistake explains why my code was consistently returning a final cost of 0 for most cases as the code would always just return an empty Integer[]. I then spent a while trouble shooting why despite fixing that small error that my final arraylist being returned was still always empty. I then realized another silly error, my while loop with the condition !toSearch.isEmpty() was always true because before I ran the while loop I forgot to add the very first node to the queue so the while loop never even ran. After spending a while fixing these two errors and also making small other tweaks to the code I then started to generate some numbers for my final cost (though they were all incorrect). Now it's a matter of tracing to code to find why its incorrectly adding up numbers or generating the sub-arrays. |

I suspect that my code is counting the number of nodes in a single subgraph incorrectly which is why my cost function isn't calculating the correct final price. Although this is an improvement over before as I've gotten my answers significantly closer to the correct ones than the original tests. I realized I was keeping track of the current count of nodes in a graph incorrectly so I fixed that but my code still isn't generating the correct answer. Something I want to try doing in the future is instead of brute forcing all of the subgraphs via a for loop maybe I can actually have my code generate the overall graph itself then afterwards count the number of subgraphs, though I'm not sure how to implement it. |

In this class period I worked through implementing path compression (in my while loops) into my code. Although, something interesting I noticed was that there was a very marginal code speed increase (or even none at all) when run our test cases. |
