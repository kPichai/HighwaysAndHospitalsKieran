| Sept 11 | 10:25pm - 10:55pm | For this initial attempt (I didn't code anything) but I came up with a few interesting ideas on how to approach, understand and solve this problem. First, my intial idea was that if we are given the overall board then it'll be difficult to solve the problem, however, if we break it up into sub problems (for example if we have an 'island' that is disconnected from the other groups) then we can treat that as its own problem. Another thing I though is that if price of highway < price hospital then we simply need to find the # of highways that has a greater cost than a single hospital. Therefore, we can know how many highways away from a single hospital you have to be in order to have a new highway. For example, if you a highway is 2$ and a hospital is 3$ then if you have a single town that takes 2 roads to connect it to another hospital, you might as well just build a hospital there because its cheaper than building 2 highways. |

My goal is to loop through all the cities and store an arraylist of the number of cities in each sub group (each disconnected graph). Then, at the end you return the sum of the number of nodes in a given sub graph - 1 * highway cost + a single cost of hospital (is hospital price is > than highway). If highway is more expensive then just place a hospital at every node. For this algorithm to work we will also create a map for O(1) look up times to see if you have already visited a node. This helps you decide when to move onto a new sub tree or when to create one. |

I coded a helper function that essentially returns in Integer[] storing the number of nodes in each sub graph / disconnected graph. Although I'm yet to test this function I coded it to use BFS to explore every single set of nodes. If it completes a loop and can't continue in its current tree then it simply moves to the next tree and appends the number of nodes in the last subtree to an arraylist. I also coded the code to calculate the cost given the two scenarios, the simple scenario where the highways are more expensive than hospitals in which you just return n*hospital price. I also have coded the method of calculating the cost if you have the other case, which is more complex. |
